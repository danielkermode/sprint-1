## The Command Line

The command line is a program on your computer that allows you to type words that make your computer do something.

Each time you type a word and run that 'command', the computer checks where your command line program is currently 'at', given by the words before a funny looking symbol in the program window. It will be 'at' a folder in your computer, and the command you type will be run at this folder.

eg. `linux:/home$` Your command line is at the 'home' folder, and any commands you type and run will be executed in the context of this folder.

##Commands

Commands differ between operating systems, but here are 10 linux commands:

1. `cal` - Displays a calender.

2. `ls` - Shows all the files/folders where your command line is 'at'.

3. `mkdir` - Create a new folder where your command line is 'at'.

4. `open` - Opens a file (file you type should exist wherever you are!) in its default application.

5. `shutdown` - Shuts down or restarts linux.

6. `wget` - Get a webpage and store the file on your computer (there's more to this one, but this is essentially what it does).

7. `cd` - Changes the program into another folder. You can give this an "absolute path" (the whole folder address)
or a "relative path" (a folder that is in the current one). If you give this any '..'s, it will find folders that contain
the current folder (essentially moving up the folder hierarchy).

8. `file` - Check the file type of a given file.

9. `echo` - Display a message that you give the command on the screen.

10. `head` - Show the first part of a given file on the screen.
